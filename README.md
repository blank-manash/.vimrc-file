## My Personal Vim Configurations

Most of the features work out of the box.
You only need an internet connection and directly to run a instance of vim which will download all the files requried.
Use the script to configure.

You can find your older configs in the name of `.vimbackup`

```
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blank-manash/.vimrc-file/main/vimrc.sh)"
```
